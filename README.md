# EXP.NO.3.-IMPLEMENTATION-OF-DELTA-MODULATION

3.Implementation of Delta Modulation 
  
## AIM    
 To study the Delta modulation using the Delta Modulation trainer kit. 
## APPARATUS REQUIRED
Trainer Kit, DSO(10MHz) , Patch Cords and Power Supply (0-30V)   
## PROCEDURE

1.Power ON the Trainer Kit
Switch on the Delta Modulation Trainer Kit and ensure all necessary modules are functional.

2.Connect the Input Signal
Connect the function generator to the input terminal of the trainer kit. Set the generator to output a low-frequency sine wave (e.g., 1 kHz, 1 Vpp).

3.Connect Output to CRO
Use BNC cables to connect the modulated output from the kit to Channel 1 of the CRO. Connect the demodulated (reconstructed) output to Channel 2 of the CRO.

4.Observe Modulated Signal
On the oscilloscope, observe the digital Delta Modulated waveform. It should appear as a staircase or two-level binary waveform.

5.Observe Demodulated Signal
Now observe the demodulated output waveform on the second channel. Compare it to the input waveform from the function generator.

6.Adjust Parameters
Vary the sampling rate and input frequency. Observe how the output waveforms change. Too high an input frequency or too low a sampling rate may lead to slope overload distortion.

7.Record Observations
Note down the waveforms seen on the CRO for different configurations. Take screenshots or sketch the waveforms for report purposes.

## OUTPUT GRAPHS



## RESULT 

The Delta Modulated signal was successfully generated and observed.

The modulated signal was a 2-level step waveform representing the slope changes of the input.

The demodulated signal approximated the original analog input, with minor distortion depending on sampling rate and input frequency.

When the sampling rate was low or the input frequency high, slope overload distortion was evident.

At optimal conditions, the demodulated signal closely followed the input waveform.
